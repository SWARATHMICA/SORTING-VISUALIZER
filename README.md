## Sorting Algorithms Visualization
This project provides visualizations of various sorting algorithms using Python and Matplotlib. Each algorithm is animated to show step-by-step sorting, making it easier to understand how each one works. This repository is a great tool for learning and teaching sorting algorithms interactively.

## Project Overview
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, used for organizing data efficiently. This project visualizes the following sorting techniques:

1.Bubble Sort
2.Insertion Sort
3.Selection Sort
4.Merge Sort
5.Quick Sort
6.Heap Sort
7.Shell Sort
8.Radix Sort
Each algorithm animates the process of sorting an array, allowing users to watch the algorithm's inner workings in real time.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
**Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
**Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
**Selection Sort:** Selects the smallest (or largest) element and swaps it into place.
**Merge Sort:** Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them.
**Quick Sort:** Uses a pivot to partition the array and recursively sorts each partition.
**Heap Sort:** Builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
**Shell Sort:** Generalizes insertion sort with gap-based intervals.
**Radix Sort:** Non-comparative sorting that processes digits from least to most significant.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
